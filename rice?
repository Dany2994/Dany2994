Pro tip: 
#Slightly toast your rice to prevent aglutinant components to glue your rice (this is based on preferences)
#Add your liquid (season to taste and dietary needs), MUST BE HOT to reduce even more the amount of aglutinants naturally present in rice
#On HIGH HEAT, bring it to a boil and as soon it gets boiling, cover it with your lid, set heat to the lowest as possible and DO NOT TOUCH IT FOR 12 MINUTES!
#SET A TIMER
#After 12 minute, lift the lid, kill the heat and "bruush" your rice softly with a fork, you must see how well separated and flufy is, GOOD STUFF! 

#pro tip 2:
#DO NOT eat rice after 5 days of making it, you miught kill most of the bacteria by reheating it to safe temp zone, but toxins might be present. DON'T RISK IT!.
