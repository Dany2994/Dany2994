Pro tip: 

def make_rice():
    while True:
        try:
            cup_rice = input("How many cups of rice do you have? ")
            cup_rice = float(cup_rice)
            if cup_rice.is_integer():
                cup_rice = int(cup_rice)
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Use only numbers for cups!")
    cup_water = cup_rice * 2
    print(f"You'll need {cup_water} cups of water for those {cup_rice} cups of rice, make egg fried rice tomorrow!")
make_rice()
